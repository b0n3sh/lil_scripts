    <ul>
        <li><a href='lil_follows.js'>lil_follows</a> - Tells you who you follow on IG but doesn't follow you back.</li>
        <li><a href='nord_ssh.sh'>nord_ssh</a> - By default, <a href='https://nordvpn.com/'>NordVPN</a> doesn't allow packets to go outside its interface. Failing to find a solution to connect to my SSH while using their VPN, I came up with my own solution, which plays with iptables and
ip routing to let the packets that go through my SSH port use the default gateway.</li>
        <li><a href='nord_rotate.py'>nord_rotate</a> - Every time you want, you get a randomized IP address from the nordvpn servers.</li>
<li><a href='os_rename.py'>os_rename</a> - It renames recursively all files and folders in the current location to make it linux-friendly (i.e. removing all spaces, exclamation marks, and stuff). 
    </ul>
